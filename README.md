# SSOAuth
Single Sign On Authentication system based on OAuth2 protocols , currently authorization code flow is implemented.



Above project is code for server that will be used to authenticate multiple clients (single sign on) against their client_id,client_secret.



## How to Connect to SSO Auth Server

In middleware of current system, check for cookies there is no bearer token, proceed to following:

## 1 – STEP 1

> Redirect to  “{ssoAuthDoman} /o/oauth2/v1/auth” with params :
 
`client_id,

scope, (all)

redirect_uri, (this should be exact same as provider's domain entered in DB)

state, (this is the redirect URL where this system should redirect to after authentication)`



## 2- STEP 2

 You will get callback at your application on /auth URL , like :
 
### [GET]

`www.yoursite.com/singin-oidc?code={authorizationCode}&redirect={page_you_sent_from}`


## 3 – STEP 3

 You should then call following URL to get token :
 
`[Post]
{ssoAuthDoman}/oauth2/v1/token`

With object:

```
{
 Client_id,
 Client_secret,
 Code {that was sent by ssoAuth},
 Grant_type {authorization_code always},
 Redirect_uri {redirect URL}, 
 Domain {base URL of client}
}
```

In response to this you will get :

```
{
                            Access_token,
                            Token_type = "Bearer"
}
```


This shall be saved for current user.
